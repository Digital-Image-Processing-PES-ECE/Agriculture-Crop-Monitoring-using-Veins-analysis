# Project Name
AGRICULTURE CROP MONITORING  USING VEINS ANALYSIS

### Project Description:
presents a dual-method approach for an analyzing leaf health by detecting 
abnormal vein widths and segmenting diseased areas using HSV-based color 
segmentation. The vein analysis identifies irregular structures and color segmentation 
highlights unhealthy regions. This approach aims to detect early pest detection precisily.

#### Summary - 
This project we use vein analysis and HSV - based segmentation to automate pest 
damage detection. Vein irregularities often indicate early plant stress, while colour-based 
segmentation effectively identifies diseased regions. Together, these methods provide a 
comprehensive solution for assessing leaf health and aiding precision agriculture. 

#### Course concepts used - 
1. -image enhancment
2. -dillution
3. -Edge detetction

   
#### Additional concepts used -
1. -hsv,masking
2. - regionprops inbuilt function to find connected components in the vein structure 
   
#### Dataset -

#### Novelty - 
1. -uniquely combines vein structure irregularities or color-based segmentation to enhance detection accuracy. 
2. -The vein analysis identifies structural abnormalities which helps giving,indicative of 
pest-induced stress, while HSV segmentation highlights visual discoloration caused 
by disease or pests.

### Limitations and Future Work:
to combine both method together and get  precise output and 
informing the farmer how much it is prone to disease and informing the concentration of NPK to be used precisialy  to remove that pest
